### 3.1 C4 Model

The C4 model is a simple way to visualise the software system. Simon Brown made this model to help people who make software to explain and show how their systems are built. This can be useful when planning a system or explaining one that already exists.

The C4 model has 4 parts: 
1) C1 System Context
