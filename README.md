### 1.1 What is Diet Generator?
Diet generator is application that will generate list of the meals with all ingredients and nutrition's information based on given criteria such as
required kcal, diet targets, diet type etc. As addition, each diet will provide shopping list. 

With one click you can get diet and go straight to the shop and buy what you need, you don't need to wast time on browsing for recipe or adjusting macros. This application will do it for you.

### 1.2 Why this repository exists? 

**First reason:** This application is created as a idea that I have in mind for a couple of months/years, and finally I decided to create it.

**Second reason:** [100commits](https://100commitow.pl/) competitive event gave me motivation to begin this project and push my skills to the next level.

**Third reason:** I found that creating application from beggining to the end including deployment is extremely beneficial in
improving my skills as Software Developer. With this repository I decided to learn MongoDB, apply module monolith architecture and implement comprehensive documentation. 


### 1.3 Disclaimer

I am beginner software developer with less than 2 years experience who do it as a hobby. I never work in professional environment. I learn everything from books, online courses,
documentation, blogs, forums, youtube and AI. Forgive me if something isn't okay in this repo.

### 3.1 C4 Model

The C4 model is a simple way to visualise the software system. Simon Brown made this model to help people who make software to explain and show how their systems are built. This can be useful when planning a system or explaining one that already exists.

The C4 model has 4 parts: 
1) C1 System Context
